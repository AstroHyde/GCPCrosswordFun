# GCPCrosswordFun
-------------------------------------------------

Practice Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Terms and Definitions with this set of puzzles by Dr. Elaina Hyde. You can use these to study for certs, learn new terms, or just have fun on a cloudy weekend. For more GCP and other nonsense you can follow me on Twitter @astrohyde.


Feel free to print and share these, all I ask is that if you reproduce them in full online, credit and link back to this git area. Happy Cloud Computing!


Word of Caution: GCP is one of the fastest changing and most often updated cloud systems out there. All of the Q&A here are accurate from March 2019.
